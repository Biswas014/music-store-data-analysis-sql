# music-store-data-analysis-sql

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores an 11-table music store database—including tables for artists, albums, tracks, genres, media types, customers etc. The analysis addresses a variety of SQL questions, from basic to advanced, to demonstrate real-world data analytics skills focused on customer behavior, sales trends, and music preferences.

**Database:** PostgreSQL  
**Questions Answered:** Easy, Moderate, and Advanced sets  

## ❓ Questions Answered (Summary)

This project addresses SQL analysis tasks such as:
- Finding the senior-most employee
- Identifying countries with the most invoices
- Discovering top invoice values
- Determining the city with the best customers
- Identifying the top-spending customer
- Returning details of Rock music listeners
- Listing top artists for specific genres
- Analyzing track lengths
- Evaluating spending by genre and customer

**For full questions and solutions, see the uploaded files in the repository, including PDFs and documents covering both questions and answers.**

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The project uses 11 interconnected tables:

- **Artist** - Artist information
- **Album** - Album details linked to artists
- **Track** - Individual tracks with genre, composer, and pricing
- **Genre** - Music genres
- **MediaType** - Track media formats
- **Playlist** - User playlists
- **PlaylistTrack** - Mapping between playlists and tracks
- **Customer** - Customer details and location
- **Invoice** - Transaction records
- **InvoiceLine** - Line items within invoices
- **Employee** - Employee hierarchy and information

The uploaded schema image file provides a visual diagram of the music store database, detailing all relationships and table structures.

## 🔑 Key Insights & Findings

- Prague city generates the highest invoice totals in the dataset
- Rock music is the most dominant genre by sales
- Customer, country, and genre spend analysis reveal business opportunities
- Employee hierarchy and track/playlist analysis support business decisions

## 💻 Technical Skills Demonstrated

- SQL joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX)
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Window functions
- Data sorting and grouping
- Multi-table querying

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- PostgreSQL (used for all queries and analysis)
- Database management tools (e.g., PgAdmin, PostgreSQL CLI)

## 📝 Project Learning Approach

**My Approach:**
1. Attempted to solve each question independently first
2. Researched and understood the database schema thoroughly
3. Took help from ai tools for understanding difficult questions and tables required to solve that problems
3. When stuck on complex queries, used reference solutions to understand the logic
4. Practiced alternative query approaches to master multiple solutions

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to **Rishabh Mishra** for sharing the original music store project and helpful solutions. I attempted the questions independently first, and referred to his guidance only when facing challenges. His resources were essential for solving advanced queries and understanding project structure.
